Apache Axiom 1.4.0 Release Note
===============================

Axiom 1.4.0 fixes some regressions identified in Axiom 1.3.0:
[AXIOM-508](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIOM-508),
[AXIOM-509](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIOM-509) and
[AXIOM-512](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIOM-512).

It also features a reorganization of internal code. This should not affect code
that uses Axiom, unless it refers to internal implementation classes, in which
case that code should be fixed so that it only uses supported interfaces.

Finally, Axiom 1.4.0 also changes the minimum required Java version to 1.8.
